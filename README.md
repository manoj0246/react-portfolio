React Portfolio Website for Kesarapu Manoj Karthik
This is a personal portfolio website for Kesarapu Manoj Karthik, a final-year AI & Data Science student. It is built as a single-page application using React and features a modern, responsive design that works on all devices.

This project was created with simplicity in mind. All the necessary styles are included directly within the App.jsx component, so there is no need to configure a separate CSS preprocessor like Tailwind CSS.

Features
Responsive Design: Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Smooth Scrolling: Navigation links smoothly scroll to the corresponding sections.

Active Link Highlighting: The navigation link for the current section is automatically highlighted.

Self-Contained Component: All styles and logic are in a single file (App.jsx) for easy management.

Iconography: Uses lucide-react for clean and modern icons.

Comprehensive Sections: Includes sections for About, Skills, Experience, Projects, Education, Certifications, and Contact.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can download them from the official website.

Installation
Create a new React application.

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React project using Vite (a modern and fast build tool).

npm create vite@latest my-portfolio -- --template react

Navigate to the project directory.

cd my-portfolio

Install project dependencies.

This will install React and other necessary packages.

npm install

Install lucide-react for icons.

npm install lucide-react

Replace the default App component.

Open the src/App.jsx file in your code editor.

Delete all the content inside it.

Copy the entire code from the Canvas and paste it into src/App.jsx.

Clean up the CSS file.

Open the src/index.css file.

Delete all the content inside it. This is because all the styles are already included in the App.jsx component.
